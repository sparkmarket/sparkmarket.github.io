                <p>We respect your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy covers Invest Georgia, LLC’s (operating as SparkMarket) treatment of information that we collect and maintain about you in connection with your use of the Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Invest Georgia, LLC does not own or control or to individuals whom Invest Georgia, LLC does not employ or manage, including operators of sites you may link to or from the Website or from which you link to the Website. By using our Website, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and consent to the practices described herein.<br>
                    <br>
                We reserve the right to use and control the information collected on the Website. We will not share this information with any third                 party, other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We collect information from users at different points on our Website, as follows:<br>
                <br>                
            1. Registration: These forms (for use of the website as well as our required service providers) may ask for contact information, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, fax number and other basic contact information (“Registration Information”). After submitting your Registration Information, you can view and modify this information within the self-maintenance area of the Website. Note that Georgia residence is required for any persons wishing to invest in a posted campaign on the website, as further explained in our Terms & Conditions of Use<br>
                <br>

2. Log Information: We may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer’s name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being used.<br>
                <br>

3. Cookies: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique, but anonymous, code, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use the Website upon a future visit. We will also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Website. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of your browser. You should review the online documentation of your browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies on your computer, some parts of this Website may not function properly.<br>
                <br>

4. Referrers: A “referrer” is the information passed along by a web browser that references the web URL you linked from and is automatically collected by our web server. This information is collected and used by us to understand the websites referring traffic to our Website and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. We tabulate referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns.<br>
                <br>

5. Computer Configuration: In order to determine whether your computer is supported by our system, we may collect certain anonymous information. This information includes, but may not be limited to, your operating system and browser. This information is kept confidential and is not shared with third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Do with Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>Except as may be provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent or allowing you to decline to permit the disclosure. There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about a user without express consent, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:<br>
                <br>

1. Website Vendors: We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. In order to allow these companies to perform their obligations, we may need to share your personally identifiable information with them. However, we will provide these companies with only that information necessary to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.<br>
                <br>

2. Protection of Rights: We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe that you have harmed or interfered with (or will imminently harm or interfere with) other Website users or anyone else or have violated (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms of Use or infringed any of Invest Georgia, LLC's legal rights, or harmed the legal rights, property, or health or safety of any other person.<br>
                <br>

3. Required by Law: We will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.<br>
                <br>

4. Asset Transfers: Invest Georgia, LLC shall be entitled to transfer to a third party information it maintains, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or all of the assets relating to the Website or a business in connection with which such information is maintained.</p> 

                <h2>Modification of Personal Information; Opting Out</h2>  
                <p>To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) in the self-maintenance area of our Website to update and/or correct the information you have previously submitted.<br>
                <br>

In addition, we provide you with the ability to “opt-out of” certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions provided in the self-maintenance area.<br>
                <br>

At your request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our active databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database, please send an email to the address listed in this Privacy Policy. You will be removed from our active databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request. You may also request to review or amend any personal information that we maintain about you, by sending a written request to the same address, subject to our verification of your identity acceptance of any proposed revision.<br>
                <br>

Third Parties: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to opt out. We can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information once it has been transferred to such third parties and cannot implement your opt out requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information.</p> 
                <h2>Communications</h2>  
                <p>By providing Invest Georgia, LLC with your email address you consent to our using the e-mail address to send you service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt out of some communications. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by following the procedures provided.</p> 
                <h2>Minors</h2>  
                <p>Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for the service on the Website. We do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen (18). If we learn that a minor under the age of eighteen (18) has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will attempt to delete this information from our databases, subject to any technical limitations on our ability to do so.</p> 
                <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>  
                <p>We reserve the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of the new policy from the Privacy Policy link on the homepage of our Website. Your use of our Website following any such modification constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. If we make any significant changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to notify you prior to the date the revised policy takes effect.</p>
                <h2>Relationship to Terms of Use</h2>  
                <p>Our obligations with respect to your use of the Website are reflected in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and any additional terms of services that may be applicable.</p>
                <h2>Consent</h2>
