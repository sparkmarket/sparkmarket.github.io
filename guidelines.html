                <h2>Campaign Eligibility</h2>
                <p>If you’re a Georgia company in need of capital, you are eligible to raise money on SparkMarket via the sale of equity or debt. To be considered “Georgia based,” your Company must be organized in the State of Georgia and must have generated approximately 80% of your gross revenue within Georgia.<br>
<br>
We also accept rewards or donation-based campaigns for any creative or charitable project with specific Georgia appeal.</p>
                
                <h2>Application Steps</h2>
                <p>Please complete the campaign application form, which requests information about your company and the investment opportunity.<br>
<br>
A non-refundable application fee of $50 is due and payable upon submission of the application.<br>
<br>

Once you submit a completed application and the associated fee, we’ll review your materials and get back to you as soon as possible (typically within 72 hours) to let you know if we preliminarily approve your campaign.<br>
<br>

For equity and hybrid campaigns, if you are preliminarily approved, you will be charged a due diligence fee of $500 to cover our administrative costs of confirming the accuracy of the information you submitted, as well as a criminal background and credit check.<br>
<br>

If you don't sound any fraud alarms, you will be charged a listing fee in an amount to be determined and authorized to begin building your campaign.<br>
<br>

For rewards/donations campaigns, a due diligence fee is not required.</p> 

                <h2>Length of Application Process</h2>  
                <p>The lead time between now and being published on SparkMarket depends on the quality of information that you provide at this stage and can be up to six weeks. If we need further information about your campaign we will contact you based on the information you provide.</p>
