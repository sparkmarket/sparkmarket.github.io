                <p class="meetTheTeamP">Megan is a Georgia attorney with six years of experience with financial transactions and general business law. She is dedicated to creating a new marketplace for quality and sustainable local investment opportunities accessible by everyday Georgia residents.</p>

                <p class="meetTheTeamP">Jeff is a Georgia attorney with over six years of experience in securities and corporate law. He was one of the first attorneys to identify the crowdfunding potential of the Invest Georgia Exemption ("IGE") and has worked closely with regulators and experts in the state and national crowdfunding community to design IGE campaigns that are compliant and safe for issuers and investors.</p>

                <p class="meetTheTeamP">Among his SparkMarket peers, Marcus is the resident non-attorney; however, before having warm feelings, he spent nearly 10 years working in the banking industry. In fact, it is his experience in mortgage finance, retail banking and bank management consulting that eventually led to “Big Bank” fatigue. His refuge was found working within Atlanta’s thriving advertising/marketing industry with Cox Media Group. SparkMarket has allowed for the marriage of all these skill sets and experiences--he couldn’t be happier.</p>
