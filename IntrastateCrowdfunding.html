                <h1>Intrastate Crowfunding - Sparkmarket Consulting Makes It Happen</h1>
                
                <h2>Intrastate Crowdfunding; The Present and the Future</h2>
                <p>Currently, only three States in the Union (Georgia, Kansas and Wisconsin) have fully legalized securities based crowdfunding that permits general solicitation to the general public, both accredited and non-accredited investors. If you live in one of these States, you can legally crowdfund by offering securities (equity or debt, for example), right now! Other States are also considering legalizing intrastate crowdfunding (WI, NC, WA and NJ), and more will follow.<br>
<br>
 

Most folks have heard about national crowdfunding under Title III of the JOBS Act, while very few have heard about purely “intrastate” crowdfunding. This is going to change. Title III of the JOBS Act is expensive, cumbersome, and not yet in force (perhaps 3rd quarter of 2014). Intrastate crowdfunding is already here, and is only growing in popularity across the country.</p>
                
                <h2>SparkMarket Consulting</h2>
                <p>We’re the first platform in the US to host a successful securities campaign open to both accredited and non-accredited investors, and based on our experience, we’ve picked up a few tips that can help your business prepare for an intrastate crowdfunding campaign.<br>

 <br>

Why is a Crowdfunding Consultant Necessary? Because running a crowdfunding campaign can be a very complex endeavor. As the old saying goes, there’s no such thing as free money. While crowdfunding opens up powerful new fundraising tools, a successful campaign still requires intelligent design and proper execution. We can help you assemble a campaign that will best leverage the investor networks available to you.<br>

 <br>

What Makes an “Intrastate” Crowdfunding Campaign Different? Many things make a purely “intrastate” campaign different from a national “JOBS Act” campaign. For one thing, the laws and regulations which must be complied with are significantly different. Furthermore, reaching a purely local audience requires a much different campaign design strategy than running a national campaign.</p>
