                <h1>About Us</h1>
                
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>We believe your investment dollars should do more for you than just generate a return—they should make your hometown better, too. Our goal is to connect you with homegrown Georgia talent and give you the opportunity to financially back, through the purchase of equity or rewards, the awesome, innovative businesses, non-profits and creative projects that are happening in your own backyard.<br>
                <br>
                We also want to help you and your neighbors brainstorm the type of development that would               best serve your neighborhood. You know that old boarded-up building you drive past              everyday? What should it become? What would make your neighborhood better? You and              your            neighbors can use SparkMarket to create your dream neighborhood. And who knows? Maybe your                project will become a reality someday if enough folks band together to make it happen.</p>
                
                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>We’re lawyers and former bankers who didn’t feel fulfilled doing work in the old-guard financial world. We wanted to be part of something new, something we cared about and have a ton of fun doing it. So we created SparkMarket—a one of a kind neighborhood marketplace designed around a unique Georgia law known as the Invest Georgia Exemption (“IGE”), which lets Georgia businesses advertise investment offerings to everyday Georgia residents.<br>
                <br>
                Since 2011, we have been working to build the infrastructure that would make local investing a reality. We were among the first to spot the potential of the IGE, and we helped frame the rule, which places Georgia on the leading edge of the movement to legalize local crowdfunding.</p> 

                <h2>Why Do We Care About Local Investing?</h2>  
                <p>As investors, you should be able to put your money into enterprises that you understand and have a connection to. Investing in local businesses not only provides a crucial financial lifeline to a sector that’s been hit hard by the credit crisis of recent years, it also bolsters the economic stability of your region. Small businesses create 2 out of every 3 jobs and recirculate more money locally than businesses owned by folks outside of a region. So join us and put your dollars to work in the people and places you believe in.</p>
